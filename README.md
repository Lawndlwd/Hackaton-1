# Simple MVC (For API connection)

## Description

This repository is a simple PHP MVC structure from scratch.

It uses some cool vendors/libraries such as Twig, Grumphp and symfony/http-client for API connection.
For this one, just a simple example where users can display a pic of the day from NASA API.

## Steps

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`. 
3. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
7. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
